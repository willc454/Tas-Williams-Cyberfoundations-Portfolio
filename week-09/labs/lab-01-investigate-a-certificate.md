# Week 9 Lab 01 - Investigate a Certificate

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** September 21, 2026

**Module:** 3 - Practical Cryptography | **Week:** 9  
**Submission Path:** `week-09/labs/lab-01-investigate-a-certificate.md`

> ## Vault Exchange Trust and Key Safety Rule
> Inspect a public website without signing in. Do not click past a browser certificate warning, add a practice issuing office (CA) to your browser’s accepted list, or upload secret private keys. Keep all Week 6-8 VM files, SSH keys, and access settings unchanged. This lab makes no security-rule changes.
>
> **Evidence safety:** Capture the certificate viewer, not your account, bookmarks, browser address bar, passwords, or Bastion access URL. Record the public hostname as text in this worksheet.

## Mission

Ivy has two digital keys. Both say “Vault Exchange Support.” How can she tell which one belongs to the support team? A label alone is not enough.

Think of a visitor showing a badge at a front desk. The guard checks the name, the dates, and the office that issued it. In this lab, you will look at a website’s digital badge, called a **certificate**. You will write down what you see and follow the list of offices that signed it. You are looking and recording; you are not changing the website.

A visitor badge has a name, issuing office, validity period, and permitted use. A certificate similarly supplies information to check. A polished badge does not make its issuer trusted, and a certificate does not guarantee that a website's advice or downloads are safe.

## What You Already Know

You do not need to memorize last week’s vocabulary. Use these reminders:

- A **public key** is the shareable part of a pair of digital keys. Its label alone does not prove who owns it.
- A **private key** is the secret part. Keep it private, like a key to a locked room.
- A **digital signature** is a mathematical check made with a private key. It helps detect changes and check which matching key signed something.
- A **browser** is the app you use to visit websites. It checks certificates for you.
- A **hostname** is a website’s name, such as `example.com`. It does not include `https://` or the page name after the slash.

Our question is: “Does this digital badge fit the website I meant to visit, and does my browser accept the office behind it?”

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Your normal desktop browser; assigned VM is not needed for this investigation |
| Public target | Start with `https://example.com`; use an instructor-approved public HTTPS site if unavailable |
| Change level | Read-only inspection; no sign-in, certificate import, or warning bypass |
| Time | 35-50 minutes; pause and resume as needed |
| Evidence | Certificate fields, browser chain view, dated observations, and your explanation |

- [x] I have watched Lessons 1-3 or reviewed their slides.

- [x] I can open the public site without signing in.

- [x] I know that live issuer names and dates may differ from the lesson images.

- [x] I will write “not observed” when the viewer does not expose a field.

### Cloud Heights Idle Stop

This browser investigation can be completed while your VM is stopped. If you also open Cloud Heights, respond to its idle warning only while actively working. Restart a stopped VM from My Lab Environment when you need it; do not rebuild it.

## Predict First

A visitor’s badge has not expired. Is checking the date enough to let that visitor in? What else should the guard check? Connect your prediction to a website’s certificate in 2–3 sentences. A prediction is your best guess before investigating; it does not have to be correct.

```text
Checking the date is not enough. The guard should also check that the certificate name matches the website and a trusted certificate authority issued it. I predict that the website name will match the certificate, a trusted certificate authority issued it, the date begin date is prior to today's date and the end date is later than today's date (both within the last year). 
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 - Identify the Destination and Observation

1. Open your browser and visit `https://example.com`. Do not sign in or enter a password.
2. Look at the address after the page loads. Sometimes one address sends you to another; that is a **redirect**. Write the name you ended up visiting in the table.
3. Record today’s date, time, and time zone. A time zone tells us which local clock you used.
4. Open the site-information button beside the address. Look for connection or certificate information. Wording may include “Connection is secure” or “Certificate is valid.”
5. Open the certificate details. Browser menus differ. If you cannot find them, ask your instructor to show you. Do not install anything.

**What you should see:** information about the website’s certificate. Copy the browser’s message exactly. For the browser version, use its Help/About screen if available; ask for help if needed.

| Observation | Your record |
| --- | --- |
| Starting public URL | https://example.com/ |
| Final expected hostname | https://example.com/ |
| Observation date and time | September 21, 2026 10:19PM |
| Time zone | ET |
| Browser and version | Google Chrome  140.0.7339.186 |
| Browser connection/certificate status, exactly as shown | Valid |

If a warning appears, stop before proceeding to the site. Record the warning privately and select an approved alternative with your instructor. A warning is not a request to disable verification.

### Step 2 - Read the Leaf Certificate

Select the certificate for the website itself. This is called the **leaf certificate** because it is at the end of the signing chain. Other certificates in the list belong to the offices that issued certificates.

Open Details or Fields. A **field** is one labeled piece of information, like “Name” on a badge. Work down the table one row at a time. Use this guide to understand the labels:

| Label in the viewer | Plain-language meaning |
|---|---|
| Subject | Who or what this certificate describes. |
| Subject Alternative Name (SAN) | The list of website names the certificate covers. Use this list to check the name you visited. |
| Issuer | The office that signed this certificate. Such an office is called a certificate authority, or **CA**. |
| Not Before / Not After | The start and end of the certificate’s allowed date-and-time period. |
| Subject public-key algorithm and size | The kind of public key and its size. An **algorithm** is a set of instructions for doing a calculation. Copy the label and number you see. |
| Certificate signature algorithm | The method the issuing office used to sign the certificate. This is a different job from the website’s own public key. |
| Extended Key Usage (EKU) | The listed jobs for this certificate, such as identifying a web server. |
| Basic Constraints | Whether this certificate may act as an issuing office (CA). |
| Serial number / SHA-256 fingerprint | A tracking number, or a calculated fingerprint, that helps identify the particular certificate you inspected. |

You do not need to explain how the algorithms work. In the last column below, explain the field’s job in your own words. Expand a long list to see its entries. A Subject “Common Name” is not a substitute for checking the SAN list.

| Field | Value you observed | What question does this field help answer? |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Subject | example.com | Who the certificate is issued to? |
| Subject Alternative Name (SAN) | DNS Name: example.com DNS Name: *.example.com | What domain names and host names the certificate covers? |
| Issuer | Cloudflare TLS Issuing ECC CA 3 | Who issued and signed the certificate? |
| Not Before | Wednesday, July 29, 2026 at 6:10:08 PM | When does the certificate become valid? |
| Not After | Tuesday, October 27, 2026 at 6:17:21 PM | When does the certificate expire? |
| Subject public-key algorithm and size, if shown | Elliptic Curve Public Key | What type of public-key cryptography does the certificate use and what is its size? |
| Certificate signature algorithm | X9.62 ECDSA Signature with SHA-256 | What algorithm did the CA use to sign the certificate? |
| Extended Key Usage (EKU), if shown | Not Critical TLS WWW Server Authentication (OID.1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1) | What is the certificate authorized for? |
| Basic Constraints, if shown | Critical Is not a Certification Authority |   |
| Serial number or SHA-256 certificate fingerprint | 6153a96fd1a6ab7f4d438fc34932484299d0729d9140b3a126bb2f9c07b02200 | What unique value can be used to identify this certificate? |

Copy the matching SAN entry fully. If other names are listed, say “additional names listed.” Keep the website’s public-key information separate from the method used to sign its certificate.

**If you cannot find a field:** write “not observed” and ask your instructor. If you have confirmed that the full certificate has no EKU field, write “extension not present.” Not seeing a label in a limited viewer does not prove it is missing from the certificate.

### Step 3 - Check the Website Name and Dates

Now do two badge checks yourself: “Right name?” and “Still within its dates?” A wildcard is a `*` that stands in for part of a name.

1. Compare your final expected hostname with the leaf's DNS SAN entries. For a wildcard, `*.example.com` ordinarily matches one label such as `shop.example.com`, not `example.com` or `a.shop.example.com`.
2. Compare the observation time with Not Before and Not After using consistent time zones. Do not change your device clock.
3. Record the browser result separately from the field comparison.

```text
Expected hostname: example.com
Matching SAN entry, or no match: DNS Name: example.com
DNS Name: *.example.com
Why the entry matches or does not match: The entry matches because it is the same as the website name  and the certificate also includes a wildcard with the same domain name.
Observation time and certificate time zone: Current dates and times of the lab assignment: September 21, 2029
Is your observation time between the start and end dates? Explain: Yes, the certificate was issued prior to the assignment on July 29, 2026 and expires afte2026).r completion of the assignment (October 27, 2026).
Browser-reported result: The browser reported the connection was secure and the certificate was valid.
What I checked myself versus what the browser reported: I checked the SAN for a match with the website name and checked the certificate's validity period.
```

### Step 4 - Map the Observed Chain

Look for a view called **hierarchy**, **certification path**, or **chain**. These are names for the list of certificates linked by signatures.

Think of a badge office approved by a larger office:

- **Leaf:** the website’s badge.
- **Intermediate:** an issuing office between the website and the top office. There can be more than one, or none shown.
- **Root / trust anchor:** the top office your browser is set up to accept. A **client** is the program doing the checking; here, that is your browser.

Record only what your browser shows. The browser may add a root from its own stored list. This screen is not a recording of everything the website sent. Also, reading matching office names is not the same as doing the mathematical signature checks yourself.

| Position / role | Subject | Issuer | Where observed | What remains unknown? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Leaf / website | example.com | Cloudflare TLS Issuing ECC CA 3 | Leaf Certicate/Details Section | If the certificate's digital signature is mathematically valid. |
| Intermediate, if shown | Cloudflare TLS Issuing ECC CA 3 | SSL.com TLS Transit ECC CA R2 | Certification Hierarchy | The mathematical validity. |
| Additional intermediate, if shown | SSL.com TLS Transit ECC CA R2 | SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022 | Certification Hierarchy | If the certificate came from the website or the browser's own certificate store.  |
| Root / trust anchor, if shown | SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022 | Self-signed / root certificate | Certification Hierarchy | How the browswer obtained the root and established it as a trusted certificate. |

Remove unused intermediate rows or mark them “not shown.” Do not invent a three-certificate chain. If the viewer exposes only the leaf, report that limit and ask the instructor for a supported viewer demonstration.

Make a simple labeled chain sketch, or write the relationship in words:

```text
The website leaf is signed by: Cloudflare TLS Issuing ECC CA 3
That issuer is signed by (if shown): SSL.com TLS Transit ECC CA R2
The top office (root / trust anchor) shown by my browser is (or not observed): SSL.com TLS ECC Root CA 2022
Why an office signing its own badge is not enough (who must choose to accept that office?): This does not automatically make it trusted. The browser and OS must choose to trust that root by having it in its trusted certificate store.
This view is the browser's displayed path; I have / have not independently captured what the server sent: I have not independently captured what the server sent.
```

## Stop & Check

- Is the selected certificate the website leaf, rather than its CA?
- Did you distinguish the subject key from the issuer's signature algorithm?
- Did you record the actual observation date and time zone?
- Did you label a field you could not see as “not observed”?
- Did you explain why an office signing its own badge does not make everyone accept that office?

## Test

Your test is to compare the name and dates, then record the browser’s result. Write “I checked…” for your own work and “The browser reported…” for its result. You have not separately checked every signature yourself. You also have not separately checked whether an issuer canceled the certificate early; that is called **revocation**. Do not claim checks you did not perform.

## Capture Evidence

Capture the expanded leaf fields and the chain/hierarchy view. Use additional numbered images when one image cannot show all fields legibly. Include captions describing what each screenshot proves. Keep account details and browser address bars outside the crop.

## Explain

Write 3–4 sentences using the visitor-badge example. Explain one field, who signed the website’s certificate, why the browser accepts the top office, and one thing a certificate cannot promise. Sentence starters: “The SAN list is like…”, “The issuing office…”, “My browser accepts…”, and “This does not mean…”.

```text
The SAN list is like the names on the listed visitor's badge, showing which website names the certificate applies to. The issuing office, Cloudfare TLS Issuing ECC CA 3, signed the website's certificate. My browser accepts the top office because it is a trusted root in the browser or operating system's trusted certificate store. This does not mean the certificate guarantees that the website itself is safe or that all of its contents can be trusted. 
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Ivy has two working keys with the same label. Why does a working key or a correct signature not, by itself, prove that the key belongs to the support team? Write at least 3 sentences.

```text
A working key or correct signature by itself does not prove that the key belongs to the support team. It proves that the person signing has access to the private key that corresponds to the public key, and that a signature was created using that key. However, the key itself does not prove that it belongs to the support team because someone else could create their own key pair and give it the same label, or the private key could have been maliciously accessed. To establish and prove ownership, the public key must be connected to the support team through a trusted source, such as a certificate or verified fingerprint. Cryptography can prove possession of a key and verify that a signature matches that key, but does not automatically prove the actual identity of the person or team using it. A certificate is useful because it helps connect a public key to an identity through a trusted certificate authority, which creates a trust relationship that helps establish who the key is associated with.  
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Anyone could print an office name on a badge. Why must the browser check more than the printed issuer name? Explain how the browser’s settings or accepted list determines which top offices it trusts. Write at least 3 sentences.

```text
The browser must check more than the printed issuer name for verification; the browser must be configured to trust the issuer. The browser uses its trusted certificate store or accepted list of root certificate authorities to determine which top offices it trusts. If the root certificate authority is included in that trusted list, the browser can use it as a trust anchor when validating the certificate chain. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** What did your name, date, and browser checks tell you about this connection? Why do they not promise that everything the website says or offers is safe? Say which checks you did and which you did not do. Write at least 3 sentences.

```text
The name check showed that the certificate's SAN included example.com. The date check showed that the certificate was within its validity period. The browser check reported that the connection was secure and the certificate was valid. A certificate does not verify a website's content; it helps verify the website's identity and the security of the connection. I checked the SAN, validity dates, and the browser's reported result; I did not independently capture what the server sent and verify the certificate signatures.
