# Week 4 Lab — File Permissions: The Badge Audit (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** August 8, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-01-file-permissions.md`

## Overview

Lesson 1 revealed what Ivy's badge rings mean: every file carries permissions — who may read, write, and execute it — and one wrongly-set ring can be a whole security incident. This lab has you run a small permissions audit of your own in the CLI Simulator: read the rings on a set of seeded files (Part A), fix three problems deliberately with `chmod` (Part B), and read the same story on the Windows side with `Get-Acl` (Part C). One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

**Nothing here can break anything real.** The CLI Simulator is a consequence-free practice space — exactly the right place to change permissions for the first time.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) — no install, no VM, no real terminal required |
| Shell | Parts A and B use **bash**; Part C uses **PowerShell** |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lesson 1 completed |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and find the **"Foundry District Badge Office"** scenario. You'll see two entries in the list: **Badge Office — Bash** (used for Parts A and B) and **Badge Office — PowerShell** (used for Part C). Start with the Bash one. It seeds a small folder of files whose permissions have… issues. That's the point.

---

## Part A — Read the Rings

### Step 1 — Get the Security Report

Run the long listing (`ls -l`) in your starting folder. This is the same listing from Week 3's `ls`, with one flag added — and that flag turns it into a per-file security report.

Command you ran:

```
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls -l
```

Output (the full listing):

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 shift-notes.txt
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    49 supply-list.txt
```

### Step 2 — Decode One File Completely

Pick any one file from your listing and decode its full permission string, audience by audience — owner, group, other — the way Lesson 1 decoded `-rwxr-xr--`. Write it as plain-English sentences ("the owner can…, the group can…, everyone else can…").

The file and its permission string:

```
-rw-r--r-- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt

```

Your plain-English decode:

```
The owner can read and write. The group can read. Everyone else can read.
```

### Step 3 — Find the Problem File

One file in this folder is dramatically more permissive than it should be — every ring lit for every audience, or close to it. Find it. (Hint: scan the *other* triplet — the last three characters — down the whole listing. Which file gives strangers the most?)

The most permissive file and why you flagged it:

```
151 master-inventory.txt is flagged because it gives permission to read and write to the others group. It is definitely common for the owner to have permission to read and write, and it can be justifiable for the group to have permission to read and write however, if necessary, others can request permissions. Furthermore, since this file's name indicates it is a master file, the group may not need reading and/or writing permissions. 
```

## Part B — Change the Rings

This is your first time changing permissions, so we follow THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE on every single change: **check who can touch it now, change it, then check again.** That means `ls -l` before *and after* every `chmod`. The simulator's checklist will verify this — a change without both checks will not pass.

### Step 1 — Lock Down the Problem File

The problem file from Part A, Step 3 should not be writable by the group or by other. Fix it: revoke write from group (`g-w`), then revoke both read and write from other. Run `ls -l` before your first change and after your last one.

Commands you ran (in order, including both ls -l checks):

```
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls -l
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ chmod g-w master-inventory.txt
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls-l
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ chmod o-rw master-inventory.txt
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls-l
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
Before:
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt

After:
-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry   151 master-inventory.txt
```

### Step 2 — Make a Script Runnable

The scenario seeds a script (its name ends in `.sh`) that its owner cannot currently execute. Grant the owner execute — and only the owner. Verify with `ls -l` after.

Commands you ran:

```
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls -l cleanup.sh
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ chmod u+x cleanup.sh
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ ls -l
```

Output (the script's corrected permission string):

```
-rwxr--r-- 1 morgan foundry    66 cleanup.sh
```

### Step 3 — Protect the Secrets File

There's a file whose name makes clear it shouldn't be readable by everyone. Revoke other's read. Verify.

Commands you ran:

```
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/badge-office$ chmod o-r badge-codes.txt
```

Output (the corrected permission string):

```
-rw-r----- 1 morgan foundry    82 badge-codes.txt
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Audit Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Run one final `ls -l` showing the whole folder with all three fixes in place, and take a screenshot of your simulator session showing it. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-permissions-audit.png`. You'll upload and embed it in the GitHub Commit section below.

## Part C — The Same Story, Windows Edition

### Step 1 — Read One File's Guest List

Switch to the PowerShell side of the scenario and run `Get-Acl` on the seeded file the scenario panel points you to. Windows shows a *list* of named accounts and rights instead of three ring-triplets.

Command you ran:

```
PS /home/morgan/badge-office> Get-Acl shift-notes.txt
```

Output (the owner line and at least one access entry):

```
Owner : morgan
Access : -rw-r--r--
```

### Step 2 — Translate One Entry

Take one access entry from your output and translate it into plain English, the same way you decoded the Linux string in Part A.

Your plain-English translation:

```
The owner has access to read and write. The group has access to read. Other's have access to read. 
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you found the problem file by scanning the *other* triplet. Why is the "other" audience usually the most important one to audit first on a shared system? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The other audience is usually the most important to audit first on a shared system to ensure proper permission controls are in place. The other audience typically would not need as much permission as the file's owner and team's working on the file. This helps protect confidentiality, integrity, and reduce errors. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** THE GATEKEEPER'S RULE requires a check before *and* after every change, even though `chmod` rarely fails. What does the *before* check protect you from, and what does the *after* check protect you from? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Using the gatekeeper's rule (command ls -l) prior to running chmod ensures that we are working with accurate information. It clearly shows each audience's permission to the file. This helps protect integrity of your work before even starting a change. If an error is made, you can go back to the original permissions to make corrections. Using the command after making a change also helps you ensure the change was made and done correctly. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Lesson 1 called least privilege "granting what's needed and revoking the rest." Pick one of your three fixes from Part B and explain it in least-privilege terms: what was granted that wasn't needed, and who could have taken advantage? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The master-inventory.txt file granted read and write permission to all three audiences. All three audiences do not need this level of permission for this file. With granting the least privilege theory in mind, only the owner of the file need privileges to read and write in this file. Audiences whose work does not align with this level of information can use it in a malicious manner. Using least privilege access helps keeps information contained and secure. 
```

**Analysis Question 4.** Windows ACLs can name specific people; Linux permissions use three fixed audiences. Describe one situation where the Windows approach would be genuinely more useful — and one cost of that extra flexibility. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
With the Windows approach all audiences are not used. The Windows approach gives one entry, named accounts and specific rights per named accounts. The Windows approach is more useful with badge access because a single user can be named and given permission which saves times and resources. 
```
