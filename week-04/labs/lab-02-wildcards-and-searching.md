# Week 4 Lab — The Archive Investigation (CLI Simulator)

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** August 8, 2026

**Module:** 1 — Digital Infrastructure & CLI | **Week:** 4  
**Submission Path:** `week-04/labs/lab-02-wildcards-and-searching.md`

---

## Overview

Lesson 2 gave you the Archive's two tools: patterns that match many filenames at once, and the magnet — `grep` — that searches *inside* files. This lab hands you an Archive of your own and a request slip with three jobs on it: match a set of files with patterns (Part A), hunt down a suspicious log entry with grep (Part B), and run the full find → check → lock down audit that combines this week's two lessons into one workflow (Part C). This lab is more independent than Lab 01 — like Week 3's Scavenger Hunt, the steps tell you *what* to accomplish, and the *how* is on you. One screenshot from this lab becomes part of ★ Deliverable 1.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | CyberFoundations CLI Simulator (browser-based, inside the Lab Portal) |
| Shell | Your choice — bash or PowerShell. The steps below show bash syntax; the Lesson 2 Resource Pack's Quick Reference has the PowerShell equivalents |
| Prerequisite | Week 4, Lessons 1 and 2 completed; Lab 01 recommended first |

**Before you start:** log into the Lab Portal, open **Week 4 → CLI Simulator**, and load the **"Foundry District Archive Investigation"** scenario. It seeds a folder of several dozen files — logs, invoices, notes — far too many to open one at a time. Good.

---

## Part A — Work the Request Slip

### Step 1 — Survey the Archive

Before filtering anything, look at what you're working with: run a plain listing of the Archive folder. You don't need to record every filename — just note roughly how many files there are and what naming families you can see (invoices, logs, notes…).

What you observed (rough count + the naming families you spotted):

```
11 files consisting of text files, logs, notes, and invoices. 
```

### Step 2 — Match One Family With a Pattern

The slip's first request: **every invoice file.** Write a pattern that matches all of them and *only* them, and test it with `ls` — remember the habit: pattern first, look at what it catches, then act.

Command you ran (your ls + pattern):

```
ls inv-*
```

Output (the matched files):

```
inv-april.txt
inv-february.txt
inv-january.txt
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 3 — Get Precise

The slip gets pickier: **only the invoices from a single month** (the scenario panel tells you which). Refine your pattern so it catches exactly those — you may need a second `*`, a `?`, or a `[ ]` set, depending on how the names are built.

Command you ran:

```
ls inv-march*
```

Output (the matched files — and nothing extra):

```
inv-march-supplement.txt
inv-march.txt
```

### Step 4 — Act on a Pattern

Create a folder named `evidence` and copy your Step 3 matches into it with a single `cp` command using your pattern. Confirm the copies landed with `ls evidence`.

Commands you ran (mkdir, cp with pattern, confirming ls):

```
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/archive$ mkdir evidence
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/archive$ cp inv-march* evidence
morgan@foundry:/home/morgan/archive$ ls evidence
```

## Part B — Run the Magnet

### Step 1 — Search One File

The slip's second request: the scenario's access log records badge events, and somewhere in it are **denied entries**. Search the log the scenario panel names for the word `denied` — and remember the Strict Teacher: decide whether you need the case-insensitive flag.

Command you ran:

```
grep DENIED door-access.log

```

Output (every matching line):

```
08:12 DENIED badge 2214 east door - retry OK
12:40 DENIED visitor badge front desk
02:47 DENIED badge 4471 storeroom door
```

### Step 2 — Find the Line That Matters

Most denied entries are routine — mistyped badges at reasonable hours. One is not. Identify the suspicious line (think: what *time* would worry you?) and record it exactly.

The suspicious line, and why you flagged it:

```
12:40 DENIED visitor badge front desk
I flagged this one because it is suspicious for someone to try to access the front desk at 12:40am. 
```

### Step 3 — Widen the Sweep

One log is never the whole story. Re-run your search across **every** log file in one command — a pattern where the filename goes. Note which files your suspicious word appears in.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i denied *.log
```

Which files contained matches:

```
door-access.log and west-access.log

```

---

## Part C — Find, Check, Lock Down

The slip's last request is the real test: **somewhere in this Archive is a file listing storeroom badge codes.** You don't know its name. You know what's inside it.

### Step 1 — Find It by Its Contents

Search every text file for the term the scenario panel gives you, in one command. Record which file comes back.

Command you ran:

```
grep -i badge-code *.txt
```

The file you found:

```
meeting-recap.txt
```

### Step 2 — Check Who Can Touch It

Before you walk away — this is the Week 4 reflex now — run the long listing on that file and read its rings. Record what you find. Is this file as locked down as its contents deserve?

Command you ran and its output:

```
ls -l meeting-recap.txt
-rw-rw-rw- 1 morgan foundry   129 meeting-recap.txt

```

Your read of the situation:

```
Everyone can read and write in this file. 
```

### Step 3 — Lock It Down

Fix the file's permissions so only its owner can read and write it — Gatekeeper's Rule applies: check, change, check again.

Commands you ran (including both ls -l checks):

```
ls -l meeting-recap.txt
chmod go-rw meeting-recap.txt
ls -l meeting-recap.txt
```

The file's permission string BEFORE and AFTER:

```
Before:
-rw-rw-rw-

After:
-rw-------
```

### Step 4 — Capture Your Investigation Evidence (REQUIRED screenshot)

Take one screenshot of your simulator session showing your Part C sequence — the search that found the file, the permission check, and the fix. **This screenshot is required — it is part of ★ Deliverable 1.** Name it `cli-search-investigation.png`. Upload and embed it via the GitHub Commit section below.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** In Part A you tested every pattern with `ls` before letting `cp` act on it. Explain what could go wrong if you skipped straight to acting — and why the stakes get higher when the command attached to the pattern is `rm`. *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Running the command 'ls' can provide security from human error prior to running other commands. Running the ls command helps you ensure you are in the correct file and executing on the correct work. If you go straight to acting on other commands, permanent changes or hard to rectify changes can be made therefore, the stakes are higher when the command is 'rm'. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Your Part B search returned several routine matches and one suspicious one. In a real security job, why is "reducing six hundred lines to three worth reading" often more valuable than any single answer the search returns? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
Reducing and filtering can assist with time and accuracy. It would not be feasible or practical to read through several hundred lines but reading a few lines can easily be done.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Part C found a sensitive file by its *contents*, then audited its *permissions*. Explain why neither skill alone would have been enough — what does each half of the workflow catch that the other misses? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
The skills to find content and edit permission are most beneficial together to be able to provide solutions. I was able to find a file by its contents and realized that the file contains sensitive information. Understanding file permissions, allowed me to check access levels to the file and make the necessary adjustments because there were groups who did not need to access to the file but had permissions.  
```

**Analysis Question 4.** The Archive had dozens of files; real systems have millions. Which habit from this lab do you think scales up the furthest into professional work, and why? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
The commands that search files will assist with professional work. These commands allows for work to be done efficiently and effectively by saving time and increasing the likelihood of retrieving accurate information. 
```
