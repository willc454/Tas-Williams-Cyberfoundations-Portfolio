# Week 6 Lab 02 — Knocking on Door 22

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** August 20, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 6  
**Submission Path:** `week-06/labs/lab-02-knocking-on-door-22.md`

> ### 🔒 Cloud Heights Security Rule
> Your Bastion link and Cloud Heights password are **private access credentials**. Never paste either into a worksheet, screenshot, GitHub repository, Circle post, or chat message. When taking screenshots, crop out the browser address bar and all login information.

## Overview

Week 5 told you SSH is how administrators reach a machine over the network, and that it knocks on **port 22**. This week you knock yourself. You are already inside Cloud Heights through Bastion — now you will open a second, nested SSH session from your machine *to itself* and watch every step of what SSH does before it lets you in.

Starts **guided**, finishes **independent**. Expect 30–40 minutes.

**This lab uses password authentication only.** SSH keys are Week 8. Do not go looking for them yet.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Cloud Heights — live Ubuntu 22.04 VM, reached through Azure Bastion |
| Username | `analyst` |
| Password | Provided separately. Never typed into this worksheet. |
| Commands used | `ssh`, `whoami`, `hostname`, `pwd`, `exit` |
| Prerequisite | Week 6 Lab 01 completed |

**Before you start:** open **My Lab Environment**, start your VM if needed, wait for **Running**, then open Cloud Heights.

## Part A — Two Ways Into the Same Room

### Step 1 — Name the Path You Already Used

You reached Cloud Heights through a browser session. Something else handled the network hop for you.

Describe, in your own words, what the Bastion/browser path did on your behalf:

```
The Bastion/browser path opened the session to the VM inside my browser. It handled the network connection between my browser and the VM. This allowed me to access the VM without having to connect to it directly over the network.
```

### Step 2 — Predict the Manual Path

You are about to type an SSH command by hand. Before you run it, write what you expect to happen and what you expect to be asked for:

```
I expect to ask for access and I expect the Azure Bastion to act as the client and Ubuntu to act as the server and answer the request. I also expect to receive a "first-connection" prompt because I never connect to the SSH before. 
```

---

## Part B — Knocking

### Step 1 — Run the SSH Command

In your Cloud Heights terminal, run:
```
ssh analyst@localhost
```

**Stop before typing anything else.**

### Step 2 — Read the First-Connection Prompt

The first time SSH connects to a host it has never seen, it shows you the host's **fingerprint** and asks whether you want to continue connecting. This is not an error. It is SSH telling you: *I have no record of this machine yet — do you recognise it?*

Paste the prompt you saw (fingerprint line included — a fingerprint is not a credential):

```
analyst@cf-student-03:~$ ssh analyst@localhost
The authenticity of host 'localhost' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:gqBITGfAbHhuwRO5XIt3O5M4ON31XtM51NbW9AZuomo.
This key is not known by any other names
Are you sure you want to continue connecting?
```

Explain why you were willing to answer `yes` here — what makes this an expected first connection rather than a suspicious one:

```
I was willing to answer yes because this is the system asking for verification for this log-in. 
```

### Step 3 — Enter Your Password

Type `yes`, then enter your password when prompted.

**Linux does not echo password input.** No characters, no dots, no asterisks appear as you type. The terminal looks frozen. It is not — type the password and press Enter.

What did the screen show while you typed:

```
There was a small grey box. It did not expand as I typed my password; it remained the same. 
```

### Step 4 — Prove You Are in the Nested Session

Inside the new session run each of these and record the output:
```
whoami
```

```
analyst
```

```
hostname
```

```
cf-student-03
```

```
pwd
```

```
/home/analyst
```

### Step 5 — Notice the Prompt

Compare the prompt now to the prompt before you ran `ssh`. Describe anything that changed and anything that looks identical, and explain why it looks that way given where you connected to:

```
Before running ssh, the prompt showed that I was in the outer VM/session. After running ssh, the prompt changed to show that I was connected to the nested/remote VM. Some parts of the prompt may look identical because both systems use the same Linux shell and similar prompt format, but the hostname or user information identifies which system I am currently connected to.
```

### Step 6 — Capture Your Evidence

Screenshot the terminal showing the first-connection prompt and the successful session.

**Required filename:** `ssh-first-connection.png`

**Crop rules.** No Bastion URL, no address bar, no password field, no login screen. The fingerprint text is fine.

### Step 7 — Leave

Run:
```
exit
```
What did the prompt look like after exiting, and how do you know you are back in the original session:

```
After running the exit command, I received this output: "Connection to local host closed"
```

## Part C — The Deliberate Failure (Independent)

### Step 1 — Knock With the Wrong Name

Run an SSH command to `localhost` using a username that does not exist on this machine — for example `ssh notauser@localhost`. Enter anything at the password prompt.

Command you ran:

```
ssh notauser@localhost
```

Output:

```
Permission denied. Please try again. 
```

### Step 2 — Read the Failure Correctly

`Permission denied` is a **failure of authentication**, not a failure of the network.

Explain what the network and SSH already had to do successfully in order for you to be told "permission denied" at all:

```
The network connection had to already successfully reach the VM. SSH also had to successfully connect in order to begin the authentication process. The failure occurred because the credentials used for authentication could not be verified because either the user does not exist or the password for that user is incorrect. 
```

---

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Distinguish *reach* from *authentication*. Which one had already succeeded when you saw a password prompt, and how do you know? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Reach proves that the network works and authentication proves access. Reach proves that a connection to the system can be established, while authentication verifies the user's identity and permission to access it. When I saw a password prompt, reach had already succeeded because my device had successfully connected to the system. Authentication had not yet succeeded because I still needed to provide valid credentials.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** You accepted a host fingerprint today because you knew you had just connected to your own machine. Describe a situation where accepting a fingerprint without thinking would be a real problem. *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Accepting a fingerprint without thinking can be a real problem if I connected to a system that I believed was legitimate but an attacker was impersonating it. If I accepted an unfamiliar host fingerprint without checking it, I could be connecting to the attacker's machine instead of the real server. This could expose my password or other sensitive information to the attacker.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** What changed and what stayed the same when you moved from the outer session into the nested SSH session, and why? *(Minimum 2 sentences.)*

```
When I moved from the outer session into the nested SSH session, the remote system I was connected to changed because I used SSH to connect from the first machine to another machine. What stayed the same was that I was still communicating through an SSH connection. This happened because SSH allows a user to securely connect from one system to another, creating a new session inside the existing one.
```

**Analysis Question 4.** A colleague says "SSH is broken, I got permission denied." Using only what you learned in this lab, what would you tell them is already working, and what would you check next? *(Minimum 3 sentences.)*

```
Here's what I would tell my colleague: The good news is that it seems as though the network connection and SSH reachability are already working because the system responded with a “permission denied” message. This suggests that the connection reached the SSH server, but authentication was unsuccessful. You should check the username and password or other credentials being used and then try entering the correct credentials again.
```
