# Week 7 Lab 02 — Read the Door Ledger

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** August 28, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 7  
**Submission Path:** `week-07/labs/lab-02-read-the-door-ledger.md`

> ## Cloud Heights Protected-Rules Safety Rule
> Four baseline rules are protected: **100** (`allow-ssh-from-bastion`), **110** (`allow-icmp-intra-vnet`), **120** (`deny-ssh-student-subnet`), and **1000** (`deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` — Inbound Deny TCP from `10.60.6.0/26` to port `8080`). **You never modify, delete, replace, or use a protected rule as a troubleshooting target.** Create or edit student rules only in priorities **200–999**. The priority **1000** fallback deny sits after your band on purpose, so a narrower Allow you create in 200–999 is evaluated first. A mistake in your student range is recoverable and is not a grading penalty when you diagnose it honestly.

## Mission

Learn to read inbound and outbound rule ledgers in evaluation order. Translate a rule from field values into plain English, then predict which matching rule makes the decision.

## What You Already Know

A network security rule is a decision about traffic. Rules are evaluated from the lowest priority number to the highest, and the first matching rule wins. Inbound and outbound traffic use separate ledgers. A configured service, a security rule, a test result, and an evidence screenshot answer different questions.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | Cloud Heights → Security Rules |
| Change level | Read-only reasoning |
| Evaluation | Lower priority number first; first match wins |
| Time | 25–30 minutes |

- [x] I am using my assigned `cf-student-XX` VM through the CyberFoundations Lab Portal.

- [x] The VM shows **Running**.

- [x] I can identify the four protected baseline rules at priorities 100, 110, 120, and 1000.

- [x] I understand that my editable priority range is 200–999.

### Cloud Heights Idle Stop

Cloud Heights may warn you that the VM is idle. Return to the Lab Portal and choose **I'm still working** if you are active. If the VM is stopped or deallocated, it was not deleted: restart it from **My Lab Environment**. Your disk files and saved configuration remain.

## Predict First

The priorities **250**, **300**, and **350** used in this lab are **hypothetical examples on paper only — do not create them**. This lab is prediction-only: do not add, edit, or delete rules, and do not run **Test My Rule** unless your instructor tells you to.

Remember the live baseline also contains the protected priority **1000** `deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` fallback (Inbound Deny TCP from `10.60.6.0/26` to port 8080), which is reached only when no earlier rule matches.

Two inbound rules match TCP 8080 from the same source: priority 250 is **Deny** and priority 300 is **Allow**. Predict the verdict before reading further.

```text
Denied. My prediction is denied because the rule with the lowest priority number denies access. Also, there is a fallback rule to deny inbound traffic to the port, even though that rule is only reached when no earlier rule matches.
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Separate the Ledgers

Scroll below the yellow protected-rules summary to the detailed lists headed **INBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER** and **OUTBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER**. Read the inbound list, then the outbound list. Record one sentence explaining why an inbound allow does not automatically create an outbound allow.

```text
There are no outbound rules created and the inbound and outbound rules are evaluated separately. 
```

### Step 2 — Translate a Rule

Choose one visible protected rule and translate it using this form:

> Read in the [direction] ledger at priority [number], [allow/deny] [protocol] traffic from [source]:[source port] to [destination]:[destination port].

```text
Read in the inbound ledger at priority 100, allow TCP traffic from 192.168.10.128/26 to port 22.
```

### Step 3 — Evaluate in Order

For each hypothetical scenario below, list the rules in evaluation order, identify the first matching rule, and state the verdict. These rules are imaginary — do not create them.

1. Priority 250 Deny TCP from `10.60.6.4` to port 8080; priority 300 Allow the same traffic.
2. Priority 300 Allow TCP from `10.60.6.4` to port 8080; priority 350 Deny TCP from any source to port 8080.
3. An inbound Allow exists, but the traffic being evaluated is outbound.

```text
1. Deny because the priority rule 250 denies the traffic.
2. Allow because the priority rule 300 allows the traffic.
3. None because the rules for outbound is being evaluated.
```

## Stop & Check

If you find yourself reading the Allow you want and ignoring an earlier matching Deny, restart at the lowest priority number. The ledger stops at the first match.

## Test

Use the displayed rule list to predict whether Grid Beacon TCP 8080 would currently be explicitly allowed by a student rule. Do not press **Test My Rule** yet unless your instructor directs you; the service may not be listening.

## Capture Evidence

Capture the detailed **INBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER** view (and **OUTBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER** if your evidence needs it), then name the first matching hypothetical rule and the resulting verdict for each scenario in your worksheet.

## Explain

Write a five-sentence explanation of first-match-wins that a classmate could use without memorizing Azure terminology.

```text
First-match-wins is the process in which the security priority rules are evaluated. The first rule that matches the traffic is applied. The  rules have a hierarchy based on their priority numbers. Lower priority numbers are evaluated before higher priority numbers. Once the matching rule is found, no other rules are evaluated. The result of that matching rule is determines whether the traffic is allowed or denied. Overall, evaluation walks the rules from the lowest priority number upward and stops at the first rule that matches. Later rules — even a perfect Allow — are never reached.
```

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** If a Deny at priority 300 and an Allow at priority 400 both match, which wins and why? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
The Deny at priority 300 wins. It wins because the rules are evaluated based on the lower number first. Priority 300 has a lower number than priority 400.  
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Why do inbound and outbound rules have to be reasoned about separately? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
Inbound and outbound rules have to be reasoned separately because they control traffic moving in different directions. Rules for traffic in one specific direction does not automatically create a rule for the same traffic in the opposite direction. It is best practice to follow the least privilege principle. Each direction of traffic should only be given the access that is strictly necessary.
```

**Analysis Question 3.** How can an Allow rule be correct by itself but ineffective in the full ledger? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
The ledger contains default rules you did not write plus custom rules you did write. The default rules, along with the custom rules, are all still evaluated in order of priority (lowest numbers get first priority). Independently from the ledger, the allow rule can be correct, but within the ledger, XXXXXX a rule with a lower number will determine the outcome.
```
