# Week 7 Lab 01 — Meet the Guard

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** August 28, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 7  
**Submission Path:** `week-07/labs/lab-01-meet-the-guard.md`

> ## Cloud Heights Protected-Rules Safety Rule
> Four baseline rules are protected: **100** (`allow-ssh-from-bastion`), **110** (`allow-icmp-intra-vnet`), **120** (`deny-ssh-student-subnet`), and **1000** (`deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` — Inbound Deny TCP from `10.60.6.0/26` to port `8080`). **You never modify, delete, replace, or use a protected rule as a troubleshooting target.** Create or edit student rules only in priorities **200–999**. The priority **1000** fallback deny sits after your band on purpose, so a narrower Allow you create in 200–999 is evaluated first. A mistake in your student range is recoverable and is not a grading penalty when you diagnose it honestly.

> **Evidence safety:** Never include a Cloud Heights password or Bastion shareable URL. Crop browser address bars and login information before committing screenshots.

## Mission

Inspect the existing NIC-level security rules on your assigned VM without changing anything. Your goal is to recognize the guardrails, separate protected rules from student-editable space, and map each visible field to the firewall mental model.

## What You Already Know

A network security rule is a decision about traffic. Rules are evaluated from the lowest priority number to the highest, and the first matching rule wins. Inbound and outbound traffic use separate ledgers. A configured service, a security rule, a test result, and an evidence screenshot answer different questions.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Environment | My Lab Environment → Cloud Heights → Security Rules |
| Change level | Read-only; do not add, edit, or delete rules |
| Expected protected rules | 100 `allow-ssh-from-bastion`; 110 `allow-icmp-intra-vnet`; 120 `deny-ssh-student-subnet`; 1000 `deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` |
| Time | 15–20 minutes |

- [x] I am using my assigned `cf-student-XX` VM through the CyberFoundations Lab Portal.

- [x] The VM shows **Running**.

- [x] I can identify the four protected baseline rules at priorities 100, 110, 120, and 1000.

- [x] I understand that my editable priority range is 200–999.

### Cloud Heights Idle Stop

Cloud Heights may warn you that the VM is idle. Return to the Lab Portal and choose **I'm still working** if you are active. If the VM is stopped or deallocated, it was not deleted: restart it from **My Lab Environment**. Your disk files and saved configuration remain.

## Predict First

Before opening the rule list, predict why a course environment would protect its access and safety rules from student edits.

```text
A course environment needs to protect its access and safety rules from student edits to prevent accidental or unauthorized changes. Without this guardrail changes can affect the integrity of the lab environment, disrupt other student's learning, have time and cost implications, and can create security concerns. 

```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Open the Guard Post

Start your VM from **My Lab Environment** first. The **Live Azure lab** card is only a launcher — all rule work happens in the Lab Portal's **Security Rules** panel. Do not work in the Azure Portal.

In Cloud Heights, scroll **below** the yellow *Protected rules — do not modify* summary to the detailed list headed **INBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER**. That detailed list, not the yellow summary, is what you inventory and capture.

### Step 2 — Inventory the Baseline

Record each protected rule exactly as shown.

| Priority | Rule name | Direction | Protocol | Source | Destination/port | Action | Protected? |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 100 | allow-ssh-from-bastion | Inbound | Tcp | 192.168.10.128/26 | 22 | Allow | Yes |
| 110 | allow-icmp-inta-vnet | Inbound | Icmp | VirtualNetwork | * | Allow | Yes |
| 120 | deny-ssh-student-subnet | Inbound | Tcp | 10.60.6.0/26 | 22 | Deny | Yes |
| 1000 | deny-tcp8080-student-subnet | Inbound | Tcp | 10.60.6.0/26 | 8080 | Deny | Yes |

### Step 3 — Map the Fields

For each field, write the question it answers: direction, source, source port, destination, destination port, protocol, action, and priority.

```text
Direction: Is traffic going inbound or outbound?
Source: Where is the traffic coming from?
Source port: What port is the source using to send traffic?
Destination: Where is the traffic going?
Destination port: Which port is the traffic trying to reach?
Protocol: What type of network traffic is being used (Tcp, Udp, Icmp)? 
Action: What the rule tells the security control to do when traffic matches (allow or deny)?
Priority: What order rules are the evaluated? 
```

## Stop & Check

- Can you edit a protected rule? You should not be able to — all four are locked.
- Where may student rules be created? Priorities 200–999.
- Which value is read first: 200 or 900? The lower number, 200.

## Test

This is a read-only lab: do not add, edit, or delete any rule. Your test is visual verification — confirm all four protected rules remain present and that no student rule was created.

## Capture Evidence

Capture the detailed **INBOUND — EVALUATION ORDER** view showing all four protected rules (100, 110, 120, 1000) and no student rule. If it does not fit in one image, use two clearly named images and explain why.

## Explain

In 3–4 sentences, explain how protected baselines and a separate student priority band reduce accidental lockout while still allowing meaningful practice.

```text
Protected baselines and separate student priority bands allows for meaningful practice. The protect baseline protects the integrity of the lab environment. A separate student priority band allows for students to engage in meaningful hands-on practice. 
```

## Required Evidence

Save screenshots in `assets/screenshots/week-07/`:

- `week07-lab01-security-rules-baseline.png`

Open each image at full size before submission. Confirm that no password, Bastion shareable URL, browser address bar, or unrelated private information is visible.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Why is a priority number part of rule behavior rather than just an identifier? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
A priority number determines the order rules are applied when multiple rules can be applied. Lower numbers are applied before higher numbers. This structure is what makes a priority number part of rule behavior because the numbers are functional and determines which rules are evaluated first; the numbers are not simply chronological, not a representation of severity, not an importance rating, and not a preference — it is a queue position.
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Explain the difference between a rule being visible, editable, and protected. (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
Rules are either visible, editable, and/or protected. Here is the breakdown of the difference between those 3 categories. 
Visible: can see and inspect the rule.
Editable: the rule's settings can be changed.
Protected: the rule can't be modified. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** Which baseline rule protects your current administrative path, and why must it never be used as a troubleshooting target? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
The protected rule protects the current administrative path. It serves as a baseline line. It should never be used as a troubleshooting target because modifications can cause unintended security or access issues. Changes to protected rules can result in administrative lockouts preventing the administrator(s) from properly managing the system. 
```
