# Week 7 Lab 05 — Break It, Explain It, Fix It

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** August 30, 2026

**Module:** 2 — Networking & Cloud Foundations | **Week:** 7  
**Submission Path:** `week-07/labs/lab-05-break-explain-fix.md`

> ## Cloud Heights Protected-Rules Safety Rule
> Four baseline rules are protected: **100** (`allow-ssh-from-bastion`), **110** (`allow-icmp-intra-vnet`), **120** (`deny-ssh-student-subnet`), and **1000** (`deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` — Inbound Deny TCP from `10.60.6.0/26` to port `8080`). **You never modify, delete, replace, or use a protected rule as a troubleshooting target.** Create or edit student rules only in priorities **200–999**. The priority **1000** fallback deny sits after your band on purpose, so a narrower Allow you create in 200–999 is evaluated first. A mistake in your student range is recoverable and is not a grading penalty when you diagnose it honestly.

> **Evidence safety:** Never include a Cloud Heights password or Bastion shareable URL. Crop browser address bars and login information before committing screenshots.

## Mission

Create a controlled priority failure inside your student range, diagnose it from evidence, remove the problem, and retest. The goal is method: UNDERSTAND → PREDICT → CHANGE → TEST → VERIFY, then FORECAST → EXECUTE → VERIFY → REMEDIATE → RETEST.

## What You Already Know

A network security rule is a decision about traffic. Rules are evaluated from the lowest priority number to the highest, and the first matching rule wins. Inbound and outbound traffic use separate ledgers. A configured service, a security rule, a test result, and an evidence screenshot answer different questions.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

| Component | Details |
|---|---|
| Required setup | Lab 03 narrow Allow present; listener running |
| Safe failure | Student-created Deny only; all four protected baselines (100, 110, 120, 1000) untouched |
| Recommended temporary rule | Priority 250 Deny TCP 8080 from `10.60.6.4` |
| Time | 45–55 minutes |

- [x] I am using my assigned `cf-student-XX` VM through the CyberFoundations Lab Portal.

- [x] The VM shows **Running**.

- [x] I can identify the four protected baseline rules at priorities 100, 110, 120, and 1000.

- [x] I understand that my editable priority range is 200–999.

### Cloud Heights Idle Stop

Cloud Heights may warn you that the VM is idle. Return to the Lab Portal and choose **I'm still working** if you are active. If the VM is stopped or deallocated, it was not deleted: restart it from **My Lab Environment**. Your disk files and saved configuration remain.

## UNDERSTAND

Your working Allow is expected at priority 300 or another student value. A new matching Deny with a lower number is evaluated first and makes the later Allow unreachable for that traffic.

## Predict First — FORECAST

Predict Grid Beacon's verdict after adding a priority 250 inbound Deny for TCP 8080 from `10.60.6.4`, while leaving the working Allow in place.

```text
Predict verdict: DENIED
First-matching rule: The new priority 250 rule will be evaluated before the 300 (allow-grid-beacon-8080) allow rule because the priority 250 matches the Grid Beacon's traffic first. 
Reason: The priority 250 will be evaluated first because the rule with the lowest priority number is evaluated first and the 300 rule is never reached. The Deny rule will apply.
```

## CHANGE / EXECUTE

### Step 1 — Create the Temporary Fault

Create a student rule named `deny-grid-beacon-8080-test`:

- priority `250`
- Inbound / Deny / TCP
- source `10.60.6.4`; source port Any
- destination your assigned VM/default; destination port `8080`
- description: intentional Week 7 troubleshooting fault

Do not edit or delete the Lab 03 Allow. Do not touch the protected priorities 100, 110, 120, or 1000 — the priority 1000 `deny-tcp8080-student-subnet` fallback stays exactly as it is throughout this lab.

### Step 2 — Capture the Broken Ledger

Capture both the priority 250 Deny and the later Allow in the same ordered rule view.

## TEST / VERIFY

Wait at least 10 seconds, select Grid Beacon, and run **Test My Rule**. Expected verdict: `DENIED`.

```text
The actual result (below) matches my forecast.

DENIED

No answer at all from port 8080 before the timeout. Traffic from this source appears to be blocked — a network rule may be denying it, or a higher-priority Deny may be matching first.

Source: Grid Beacon (10.60.6.4) · Port TCP 8080
```

### Stop & Check — Diagnose Before Fixing

Confirm these healthy facts before remediation:

- VM is Running.
- Python listener is still active on 8080.
- The original Allow is still present and correctly scoped.
- The temporary Deny is evaluated first.

```text
The VM was confirmed to be running. The Phyton listener was confirmed to be active on 8080. These confirmations rule out a stopped VM and a stopped service. The Allow rule is still present and was accurately scoped. The Allow rule has a higher priority number (300) than the Deny rule (250) so it was not evaluated because the Deny was evaluated first. 
```

## REMEDIATE

Delete only the temporary `deny-grid-beacon-8080-test` rule you created. Removing the controlled fault returns the ledger to the known-good least-privilege state.

## RETEST

1. Wait at least 10 seconds and retest Grid Beacon: expected `ALLOWED`.
2. Wait at least 10 seconds and retest Other Test Source: expected `DENIED`.

```text
Retest of Grid Beacon:
ALLOWED
The connection succeeded and your web server answered (HTTP 200\n\n[stderr]\n"}]}). A rule is allowing TCP 8080 from this source.
Source: Grid Beacon (10.60.6.4) · Port TCP 8080

Retest of Other Test Source:
DENIED
No answer at all from port 8080 before the timeout. Traffic from this source appears to be blocked — a network rule may be denying it, or a higher-priority Deny may be matching first.
Source: Other Test Source (10.60.6.10) · Port TCP 8080
```

## Capture Evidence

Your sequence must show broken rules, observed denial, repaired rules, and final retest results.

## Analysis Questions

**Analysis Question 1.** Why did the correct Allow stop working even though it was never edited? (Minimum 4 sentences.)

```text
The correct Allow stopped working when I added the Deny rule even though it was never edited. The rules work based on the first-match-wins process. The new priority 250 Deny rule that was added matched the traffic before the already existing priority 300 Allow Rule. The rules are evaluated based on lowest priority numbers to highest, and once there is a match, no other rules are evaluated. The traffic reached the priority 250 Deny rule first so that rule determined the outcome and did not reach the priority 300 Allow rule. 
```

**Analysis Question 2.** Why is diagnosing from evaluation order better than changing rules by trial and error? (Minimum 4 sentences.)

```text
Diagnosing from evaluation order should be done instead of changing rules by trial and error. Diagnosing from evaluation order is an evidence-based approach to determine why traffic is being allowed or denied. Making changes based on trial and error can cause unnecessary changes, administrative lockouts, and security risks. Using the evaluation order provides a controlled process and minimizes administrative and safety risks. 
```

**Analysis Question 3.** What made this failure safe and recoverable in the course environment? (Minimum 3 sentences.)

```text
The failure was safe and recoverable in the course environment because of the administrative and baseline rules were protected. Changes made by students did not affect these rules. This allowed changes and modifications that can later be fully restored. 
```
