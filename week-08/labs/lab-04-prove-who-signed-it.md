**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** September 12, 2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-04-prove-who-signed-it.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Create a separate signing key pair, sign the incident report, verify the original, then prove that the same signature fails against a changed copy.

## What You Already Know

A digital signature uses a private key to sign and the matching public key to verify. Verification supports integrity and authenticity claims about the key. It does not encrypt the report or prove which human physically used the private key.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
cd ~/cloud-heights/week8-cryptography
test ! -e keys/week8_signing_private.pem &&   test ! -e keys/week8_signing_public.pem &&   echo "READY: signing-key paths are unused" ||   echo "STOP: signing-key file already exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

If it begins with `STOP`, do not overwrite or delete anything. Ask the instructor whether to resume or reset.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Should the original signature verify after the report content changes? Explain.

```text
No. The original signature should not verify after the report content changes. The signature is tied to the original content. Changes to the original content invalidate the signature. 
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Generate the Private Signing Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl genpkey   -algorithm RSA   -aes-256-cbc   -pkeyopt rsa_keygen_bits:2048   -out keys/week8_signing_private.pem
```

Create one **signing-key passphrase** when prompted. You will use this same passphrase in Steps 2 and 4. Do not record or screenshot it.

### Step 2 — Derive the Public Key

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl pkey   -in keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -pubout   -out keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 3 — Confirm Both Files Exist

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ls -l keys/week8_signing_private.pem keys/week8_signing_public.pem
```

Do not display the private-key contents.

### Step 4 — Sign the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -sign keys/week8_signing_private.pem   -out signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

Enter the signing-key passphrase from Step 1.

### Step 5 — Verify the Original Report

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   evidence/incident-report.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verified OK`

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-valid.png`.

### Step 6 — Change a Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
cp evidence/incident-report.txt signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
echo "Change: post-signature modification." >> signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

### Step 7 — Test the Original Signature Against the Changed Copy

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
openssl dgst -sha256   -verify keys/week8_signing_public.pem   -signature signatures/incident-report.sig   signatures/incident-report-modified.txt
```

**Required result:** `Verification failure`. Additional OpenSSL error lines are normal for this intentional failure.

**Evidence moment:** Capture this result as `week08-lab04-signature-invalid-after-change.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not create the changed copy until Step 5 returns `Verified OK`.

### Troubleshooting

- Step 2 or 4 cannot read the private key: re-enter the Step 1 signing-key passphrase.
- Step 5 reports failure: confirm you used the original report, public key, and signature paths exactly as shown.
- Step 7 reports `Verified OK`: run `tail -n 2 signatures/incident-report-modified.txt`. If the Change line is missing, repeat Step 6 once and rerun Step 7.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 4–5 sentences, explain both verification results and why signing is not encryption.

```text
The "Verified OK" result was received because the digital signature and contents of the original file matched. The signature verification confirmed that the file's contents were not changed. The "Verification failure" result was received because there was a change in the file's contents. Signing is not encryption because signing verifies the integrity of the data and the signatures are created with the corresponding key to verify authenticity, whereas encryption transforms the original plaintext data into unreadable ciphertext to provide confidentiality. 
```

## Analysis Questions

1. What does `Verified OK` establish within this lab?

```text
The "Verified OK" establishes that the sender used a private key to create a digital signature for the file, and the receiver was able to verify the signature by using the corresponding public key. The signature matches the file's content, indicating that the file's content was not changed after it was signed. 

```

2. Why did the changed copy fail verification?

```text
The changed copy failed verification because the contents did not match the contents that was original signed therefore, the original signature could not be verified. 
```

3. Why is the signed report still readable?

```text
The signed report is still readable because the report was not encrypted. A digital signature does not provide confidentiality; it only provides authenticity and integrity. 
```

4. Why does the signature alone not prove which human used the private key?

```text
The signature only proves that the key was used, but it does not prove exactly who used the key. It can be assumed that the authorized individual used the key, but it can be possible that an unauthorized individual accessed the key (and its passphrase) and used it. Other tools such as logs can help determine who actually utilized the key.
