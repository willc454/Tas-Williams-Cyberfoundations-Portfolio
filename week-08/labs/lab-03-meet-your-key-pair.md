# Week 8 Lab 03 — Meet Your Key Pair

**Student Name:** Catasia Williams

**Date Completed:** September 11, 2026

**Module:** 3 — Practical Cryptography  
**Submission Path:** `week-08/labs/lab-03-meet-your-key-pair.md`

> ## STOP — Protect secrets
> Never paste, upload, commit, or screenshot a password, passphrase, or private key. Do not run `cat` on any private-key file. Submit only the worksheet and the named screenshots. Keep all cryptographic files on the VM.

## How to Use This Lab

- **[TERMINAL]** means type or paste the command into the Cloud Heights terminal.
- **[WORKSHEET]** means type your response in this lab worksheet.
- Run commands in the order shown. Do not type the sample output.
- If your result does not match the stated success check, stop at the Troubleshooting box. Do not improvise with `sudo`, package installation, Azure settings, or SSH server configuration.

## Mission

Generate a dedicated Week 8 SSH key pair, identify its two files, and record the public-key fingerprint without exposing the private key.

## What You Already Know

The public and private keys have different jobs. The public key may be shared when appropriate. The private key stays under its owner's control. A key passphrase protects the private-key file; it is not the `analyst` account password.

## Lab Environment / Pre-Lab Check

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
whoami
cf-week8-check
test ! -e ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 &&   test ! -e ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub &&   echo "READY: Week 8 key path is unused" ||   echo "STOP: Week 8 key already exists"
```

**Continue only if:** `whoami` prints `analyst`, all checks report `PASS`, and the final line begins with `READY`.

If the final line begins with `STOP`, do not overwrite the key. Ask the instructor whether to resume with the existing key or use the approved reset.

### If the VM Stops

Return to **My Lab Environment** in the Lab Portal and start your assigned VM. A stopped or deallocated VM is not deleted; saved disk files remain.

## Predict First

**[WORKSHEET]** Which file can be distributed when appropriate: the public key or private key? Explain.

```text
The public key is designed to be openly accessed and distributed. The private key must be kept confidential and secure. The private key provides access to secured or encrypted information and is connected to a particular identity or person, so it should not be shared. If you want someone to send you an encrypted message, you provide them with public key; you keep the private key to decrypt the message. 
```

## Guided Steps

### Step 1 — Prepare the SSH Directory

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.ssh
chmod 700 ~/.ssh
```

### Step 2 — Generate the Key Pair

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -a 100   -f ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519   -C "week8-analyst-key"
```

At `Enter passphrase`, create a memorable Week 8 **key passphrase**. Type it again when asked. Nothing may appear while you type; this is normal. Do not use or enter the `analyst` account password unless it happens to be your deliberately chosen key passphrase.

### Step 3 — List the Two Key Files

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ls -l ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519 ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub
```

**Expected result:** Two filenames appear. The file ending in `.pub` is public. The file without `.pub` is private.

**Evidence moment:** Capture only this listing as `week08-lab03-key-files-permissions.png`.

### Step 4 — Display the Public-Key Fingerprint

**[TERMINAL] Run:**

```bash
ssh-keygen -lf ~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519.pub
```

**Expected result:** A line containing key size, a `SHA256:` fingerprint, the comment `week8-analyst-key`, and `ED25519`.

**Evidence moment:** Capture the fingerprint as `week08-lab03-public-key-fingerprint.png`.

## Stop & Check

Do not run `cat`, `head`, `tail`, `less`, or `nano` on `~/.ssh/week8_analyst_ed25519`.

### Troubleshooting

- `Saving key ... failed`: confirm you are signed in as `analyst`; do not use `sudo`.
- `No such file` in Step 3 or 4: return to Step 2 and check whether key generation completed.
- Existing-key warning: answer `n` and contact the instructor. Never choose overwrite.

## Explain

**[WORKSHEET]** In 3–4 sentences, explain the handling difference between the two files and the purpose of the key passphrase.

```text
The files are handled differently because one file is designed for public access and the other file is private so it must be kept confidential and secured. The public file purpose of a key passphrase is to provide an additional layer of protection to the private key. The 
```

## Analysis Questions

1. Why can the public key be distributed while the private key must remain protected?

```text
The public key is designed to be distributed because it allows someone to encrypt information or verify a signature. The private key must remain protected because it is used to decrypt information and prove identity. 
```

2. How is the key passphrase different from the `analyst` account password?

```text
The key passphrase is different from the analyst account password because that password authentication to a system (i.e. my VM) whereas, the key passphrase is an additional layer of protection for the SSH private key and is used to protect the key from unauthorized use. 
```

3. Why did you use a unique Week 8 filename?

```text
A unique Week 8 filename needed to be used to ensure the key remains separate from other keys. 
```
